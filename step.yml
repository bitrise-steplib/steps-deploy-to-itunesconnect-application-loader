title: Deploy to iTunes Connect - Application Loader
summary: Uploads binaries (.ipa / .pkg files) to [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/).
description: |-
  Upload your binaries to [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/) using Apple's Application Loader. You can upload iOS, macOS, or Apple TV apps with the Step. The Step does not upload metadata, screenshots, nor does it submit your app for review. For that, use the **Deploy to iTunesConnect** Step.
  
  This Step, however, does NOT build your binary: to create an IPA or PKG file, you need the right version of the **Xcode Archive** Step, or any other Step that is capable of building a binary file.  
  
  ### Configuring the Step 
  
  Before you start using this Step, you need to do a couple of things:
  
  * Register an app on the **My Apps** page of iTunes Connect. Click on the *plus sign* and select the **New App** option. This requires an **admin** account.
  * This Step requires an app signed with App Store Distibution provisioning profile. Make sure that you use the correct code signing files and the correct export method with the Step that builds your binary.
  * Every build that you want to push to iTunes Connect must have a unique build and version number pair. Increment either or both before a new deploy to iTunes Connect.
  
  To deploy your app with the Step: 
  1. Make sure that either the **IPA path** or the **PKG path** input has a valid value. The default value is perfect for most cases: it points to the output generated by the **Xcode Archive** Step.
  1. In the **Platform** input, set the platform of your app. If, for example, you have an iOS app, set it to `ios`. The Step will fail if this input isn't set correctly.
  1. Add your Apple ID information for authentication. The information must be added as Secrets to the following inputs:
     - **Apple ID**.
     - **Password**.
     - Optionally, **Application specific password**. Use this to bypass two-factor authentication on iTunesConnect. 

  ### Troubleshooting
  
  Make sure your Apple ID credentials are correct. Be aware that if you use two-factor authentication, you need to submit an application-specific password.
  
  Always make sure that **Platform** input is set to the correct value.
  
  The Step can also fail if the **Xcode Archive** Step - or any other Step that builds your binary - did not generate an IPA or PKG with a `app-store` export method.
